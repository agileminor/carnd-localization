# Overview
This repository contains the code for the localization project for Term 2 of Udacity's Self-Driving Car Nanodegree.
All code and data except src/particle_filter.cpp was provided by Udacity.


## Project Introduction
Your robot has been kidnapped and transported to a new location! Luckily it has a map of this location, a (noisy) GPS estimate of its initial location, and lots of (noisy) sensor and control data.

In this project you will implement a 2 dimensional particle filter in C++. Your particle filter will be given a map and some initial localization information (analogous to what a GPS would provide). At each time step your filter will also get observation and control data. 

## Running the Code
Once you have this repository on your machine, `cd` into the repository's root directory and run the following commands from the command line:

```
> ./clean.sh
> ./build.sh
> ./run.sh
```

> **NOTE**
> If you get any `command not found` problems, you will have to install 
> the associated dependencies (for example, 
> [cmake](https://cmake.org/install/))


# Implementing the Particle Filter
The directory structure of this repository is as follows:

```
root
|   build.sh
|   clean.sh
|   CMakeLists.txt
|   README.md
|   run.sh
|
|___data
|   |   control_data.txt
|   |   gt_data.txt
|   |   map_data.txt
|   |
|   |___observation
|       |   observations_000001.txt
|       |   ... 
|       |   observations_002444.txt
|   
|___src
    |   helper_functions.h
    |   main.cpp
    |   map.h
    |   particle_filter.cpp
    |   particle_filter.h
```

The only file you should modify is `particle_filter.cpp` in the `src` directory. The file contains the scaffolding of a `ParticleFilter` class and some associated methods. Read through the code, the comments, and the header file `particle_filter.h` to get a sense for what this code is expected to do.

If you are interested, take a look at `src/main.cpp` as well. This file contains the code that will actually be running your particle filter and calling the associated methods.

## Inputs to the Particle Filter
You can find the inputs to the particle filter in the `data` directory. 

#### The Map*
`map_data.txt` includes the position of landmarks (in meters) on an arbitrary Cartesian coordinate system. Each row has three columns
1. x position
2. y position
3. landmark id

> * Map data provided by 3D Mapping Solutions GmbH.


#### Control Data
`control_data.txt` contains rows of control data. Each row corresponds to the control data for the corresponding time step. The two columns represent
1. vehicle speed (in meters per second)
2. vehicle yaw rate (in radians per second)

#### Observation Data
The `observation` directory includes around 2000 files. Each file is numbered according to the timestep in which that observation takes place. 

These files contain observation data for all "observable" landmarks. Here observable means the landmark is sufficiently close to the vehicle. Each row in these files corresponds to a single landmark. The two columns represent:
1. x distance to the landmark in meters (right is positive) RELATIVE TO THE VEHICLE. 
2. y distance to the landmark in meters (forward is positive) RELATIVE TO THE VEHICLE.
